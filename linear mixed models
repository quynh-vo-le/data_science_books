We discussed the Petuna analysis with Quynh today and our discussion included linear mixed models. I found an excellent text book, while it is not written for a beginner and probably not appropriate to dwelve into now, it seems really good and in-depth so I am sharing the link for future reference: https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/applied-biostatistics_bookdown/_book/models-with-random-effects-blocking-and-pseudoreplication
